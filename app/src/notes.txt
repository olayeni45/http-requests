REST API has multiple endpoints: GET /users, POST /products
*JSON Data is Exchanged
*Any server-side language, any frontend framework
*Stateless

GraphQL API has only one endpoint which can only be accessed with one endpoint
POST /graphql 	
*JSON Data is exchanged
*Any server-side language, any frontend framework

URL-Driven vs Query Language
REST: POST /user {name:'Max'}

GraphQL: POST /graphql {query: 'query'}
A graphql query
{
	query{
		user{
			name
			age
		}
		
	}
}

Functions are objects in JavaScript so they'll be re-created everytime once the component re-renders
